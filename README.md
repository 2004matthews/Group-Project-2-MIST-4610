# Dataset Description:
We have obtained our database from the US Data gov website at https://catalog.data.gov/dataset. 

The California Safe Cosmetics Program (CSCP), under The CDPH collects data on products sold in California that contain ingredients linked to cancer, birth defects, or reproductive harm. Companies with over $1M in annual sales and operating since 2007 must report products with these chemicals.

The dataset includes product labels, brands, manufacturers, categories, reported chemical ingredients (with CAS#), the number of chemicals per product, and dates of reporting or reformulation. It aims to inform the public about potentially hazardous cosmetics but may lack full coverage due to underreporting by companies.

Our database showcases chemicals in cosmetics primarily. It shows the specific product name, company name (Ex- Gloverâ€™s medicated Shampoo made by J. Strickland & Co.)
, product category (Ex- Hair Care products), chemical used (Ex- Distillates (coal tar)), and chemical count based on a scale from 0-2 (Ex-2)). Additionally, it provides the initial date imported and most recent dated (Ex-7/1/2009, 7/1/2009).
